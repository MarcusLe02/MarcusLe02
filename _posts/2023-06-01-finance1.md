It’s the first day in the second half of 2023, and it would be a great way to start this blog by sharing a habit that I’ve built for almost two years that totally changes my life. It helps me ease all the financial worries as a college student – Expense Tracking & Planning.

<h3>Why Personal Finance for college students is important?</h3>

Vietnamese college students, who are often away from their families, must manage their monthly budgets and make financial decisions on their own. Without proper control, they may overspend before receiving next monthly allowances (I spent the triple amount of the planned spending for my first month in college). Being aware and in control of their financial situations is not only important to manage the monthly spending, but also help them understand their current financial situation and plan for the future.

<h3>Available tools and their drawbacks</h3>

When it comes to managing their finances, college students have a variety of tools at their disposal. From traditional methods like budgeting with pen and paper, to modern digital solutions like budgeting apps, there are numerous options to choose from. While budgeting with pen and paper may be simple and straightforward, it can also be time-consuming and lacks the convenience of digital tools.

Budgeting apps, like MoneyLover and Mint, are great for people with consistent income and a desire to spend time learning the app’s features. But for college students, who have fluctuating income, limited financial knowledge, and may not have the patience for a complicated app, these tools can be too much.

A simple template for personal finance for college students, provides a more manageable solution. It has a straightforward interface, making it easier for students to build their spending tracking habits. After understanding the basics, they could then use more advanced techniques in Personal Finance.

This template is inspired by the approach given by <a href="hieu.tv" target="_blank">hieu.tv</a> throughout Financial Freedom series, the details of which could be found <a href="https://youtu.be/lKhIompb0M0" target="_blank">here</a>. The template consists of three sheets, you can find it at the end of this blog:

<h3>Understanding Reinforcement Learning</h3>

At its core, Reinforcement Learning is about an agent (you can think of an agent like a robot) learning to make decisions by interacting with its environment. The goal is to perform actions that yield the highest cumulative rewards over time. What sets RL apart from other Machine Learning methods is that it doesn’t rely on pre-labeled data or historical examples. Instead, the agent learns through a process of trial and error in many iterations, making decisions and adjusting based on the outcomes of previous iterations.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Expenses:</strong> where you log in every spending you make</li>
  <li><strong>Expenses Summary:</strong> automatically summarize your spendings by month and categories, give you a broader view of your spending</li>
  <li><strong>Balance Sheet + Goals:</strong> where you track your cash flow, and give you room to set financial targets</li>
</ul>

<p>I have been using the following template and guided steps for more than a year. It indeed helps me in managing my daily tracking and planning ahead to reach short-term financial targets.</p>

  <h3>Build expenses tracking habits</h3>
  <p>The first baby step is to develop a consistent habit of tracking. By tracking every penny you make, you can identify bad and good spending and gradually build your financial literacy. Otherwise, it can be easy to start spending money on auto-pilot, and all the unrecorded tiny expenses could add up to a big gap in your bank account.</p>

  <p>It requires a simple work every day: log every spending record you make into the Note-taking app in your smartphone. It is also recommended to use note-taking apps that allow syncing between your phone and laptop. Each record only consists of the spending purpose & the spending value. A “Petrol 50” record indicates that I spent 50,000 VND for petrol for my motorbike.</p>

  <p>Then, cut and paste the records into the Expenses sheet as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Paste the full records into column A</li>
    <li>Fill column B & C for Month & Category of the spending (Category is a drop-down list includes of 13 spending categories that I’ve set)</li>
    <li>Fill the value of the record in one of columns D, E, or F based on their importance: Must-have, Nice-to-have, Wasted</li>
  </ul>

  <p>After completing the above steps, you would get the Excel sheet similar to the one below:</p>

  <p>Then, you can have a summary of Monthly spending by Importance and Monthly spending by Category as follows:</p>

  <p>Click Expenses Summary sheet → click onto a cell in a table → Pivot Table Analyse → Refresh to update the pivot tables The pivot tables would come in handy after you build the habits for a few months, in which you can draw comparisons of your spending in each month.</p>

<div class="row mt-3">
  <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    <img src="monthly-spending-importance-image-link" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" alt="Monthly spending by Importance" zoomable="true">
  </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">
  Monthly spending by Importance
</div>

<p>By summarizing your spending, you can draw your comparisons between different categories and importance levels, thus understand your current spending habit and try to improve it.</p>

<div class="row mt-3">
  <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    <img src="monthly-spending-category-image-link" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" alt="Monthly spending by Category" zoomable="true">
  </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">

</div>

<p>In the next part of this topic, I will share about reviewing your own Balance Sheet and setting Financial Targets. But they can not be done without your own awareness of your spending. Until then, enjoy your tracking.</p>
